# Solder
Basic HackClub Solder
This is not my first project, I also made de Hackpad, but it ended with me following blindly the instructions without really uderstanding what I was doing, so i started this project, a more basic one, so that I could understand the process.

## Functions
It is only a light, not very complex because that wasn't my objective, I wanted an easy basic project that I could fully understand.

## BOM
2x LED
2x Resistor
1x Battery holder
1x PCB
